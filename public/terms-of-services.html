            <h1>Streak Terms of Service</h1>

            <p>Streak Holdings, Inc. ("Streak" or "we") makes available the Streak platform through which fans and other users can interact with athletes to expand, enhance, and deepen their relationships (the "Platform"). The Platform also permits users to (a) purchase or otherwise obtain unique, blockchain-based non-fungible tokens created by or on behalf of Streak or third parties (each, an "NFT") and (b) access, via the NFT, one or more works of authorship associated with such NFT ("Digital Content") (each NFT and associated Digital Content, collectively, the "Digital Collectible"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to your access to and use of the Platform, acquisition of Digital Collectibles, and all services made available on the Platform (collectively, our "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to these Terms, including the mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver in Section 16. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Services.</p>
            <p>We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the updated Terms on the Platform or sending an email to you at the most recent email address that we have on file for you. The "Last Updated" legend above indicates when these Terms were last changed. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the updated Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using our Services. Any changes to these Terms will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the updated Terms incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <u><a href="mailto:support@streak.us">support@streak.us</a></u></p>

The Digital Content may include copyrighted materials, trade names, trademarks or service marks, and names, likenesses, or images of third-party licensors or individuals or entities associated with those licensors. It is important to understand, and you hereby acknowledge and agree, that the NFT is separate from the Digital Content. If you are acquiring a Digital Collectible, you (a) acknowledge that although the NFT itself is sold or otherwise transferred to you, the Digital Content associated with the NFT is licensed to you, and not sold or otherwise transferred to you and (b) agree to the following terms with respect to such Digital Content:</span>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Limited License: Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Streak hereby grants to you, to the extent of its respective rights in the Digital Content, and solely for so long as you are the legal owner of the NFT, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access, perform and/or display the Digital Content using the NFT, solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. Except for the license granted above, Streak and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Digital Content.</li>
                                <li>Restrictions: You may not, or attempt to, or permit or enable any third party to: (a) separate the Digital Content from the NFT; (b) modify the Digital Content; (c) trademark, copyright or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Digital Content; (d) use the Digital Content in connection with images, videos or other content, including content that is hateful, intolerant, violent, cruel or that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or infringe upon the rights of others; (e) use the Digital Content in connection with any business, message, product, or service, or in any manner that may imply endorsement of any business, message, product, or service; or (f) use the Digital Content in any manner that is likely to cause confusion or dilute, blur, or tarnish the Digital Content or any intellectual property rights in the Digital Content.                                </li>
                                <li>Ownership of Digital Content: The Digital Content, together with all intellectual property rights in the Digital Content, is owned by Streak or its licensors. All use of the Digital Content, including any goodwill generated by such use, will inure to the benefit of Streak or its licensors.</li>
                                <li>Royalties: You acknowledge and agree that Streak or its licensors, or its or their designee(s), may receive royalties from your purchase of an NFT.                                </li>

                    <span> Your User Account and Account Security</span>
                    <p>You need to register for an account to access our Services. When you register for an account, you must provide accurate account information and promptly update this information if it changes. You also must maintain the security of your account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your account without your permission. You must not permit others to use your account credentials. You are responsible for the activities of any users that occur in connection with your account. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames, including on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim, including trademark rights, in those usernames. Your account is subject to the following conditions:                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Access: You understand and agree that access to your account is limited solely to you. You agree that you will not sell, rent, lease, or grant access to your account to any person without our prior written permission.                        </li>
                        <li>Security: You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your account and control over any usernames, passwords, or any other codes that you use to access our Services. Any unauthorized access to your account by third parties could result in the loss or theft of Digital Collectibles held in your account and any associated accounts, including your credit or debit card(s). You understand and agree that you will not hold us responsible for managing and maintaining the security of your account. You further understand and agree that we are not responsible (and you will not hold us responsible) for any unauthorized access to or use of your account. You are responsible for monitoring your account. If you notice any unauthorized or suspicious activity in your account, please notify us immediately.                        </li>

To ensure that you receive all of our communications, you agree to keep your email address and telephone number current and notify us if there are any changes. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications delivered to your email address on record is considered valid.                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span> Suspension of Account</span>
                    <p>You agree that we have the right to immediately suspend your account, pause or cancel your access to our Services, or close your account if we suspect, in our sole discretion, that (a) your account is being used for money laundering or any illegal activity, (b) you have concealed or provided false identification information or other details, (c) you have engaged in fraudulent activity, or (d) you have engaged in transactions in violation of these Terms.                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span>Hosted Wallets</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hosted Wallets: We will retain the private keys for any NFTs stored in your wallet that are hosted on our Services (your "Hosted Wallet"), for which private keys are necessary in order to transfer any NFTs out of your Hosted Wallet. Streak will use the private keys in order to effect the transfers initiated using your account.</li>
                        <li>Approved External Accounts: You may wish to transfer NFTs to and from an account, wallet, or address not hosted or controlled by Streak ("External Account"). We may require that you verify your control over an External Account or satisfy other verification or screening requirements prior to enabling transfers between the applicable External Account and your Hosted Wallet (any of these External Accounts, an "Approved External Account").</li>
                        <li>Transfers to Your Hosted Wallet: You may periodically at your discretion transfer from an Approved External Account to your Hosted Wallet any NFTs that are supported for transfer and storage using our Services. If you transfer to your Hosted Wallet any NFTs that are not supported by our Services, or if you transfer NFTs specifying an address that does not support the NFTs, those NFTs may be permanently lost.</li>
                        <li>Transfers from Your Hosted Wallet: Subject to any limits on the amounts that you are able to withdraw on a daily or other periodic basis, you may periodically at your discretion withdraw NFTs by transferring NFTs from your Hosted Wallet to an External Account controlled by you. We may require you to verify that any External Account to which you seek to transfer NFTs is an Approved External Account. You hereby authorize Streak to use your Hosted Wallet to send to any External Accountspecified by you the number of NFTs specified by you using our Services.</li>
                        <li>Other Terms Applicable to Transfers: You will be responsible for: (a) paying all fees charged by any third party associated with any External Account or Approved External Account and for paying any fees charged by Streak for any transfers; (b) ensuring that any transfers are handled in compliance with Streak requirements, third-party requirements, NFT requirements, and applicable laws, rules, and regulations; (c) ensuring that the address to which any NFTs are to be transferred is properly formatted and suitable for the type of NFT being transferred; and (d) ensuring that there are no errors in any of the transfer instructions you provide using our Services. In the event you fail to comply with any requirements of this section, the transferred NFTs may be permanently lost. Because any blockchain used to confirm transfer of any NFT is a decentralized network of independent third parties, Streak has no control over them, and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transfer will be confirmed on any blockchain. The transfer requests you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the blockchain for the applicable NFT. When you complete a transfer request via our Services, you authorize Streak to submit your transfer request to the applicable blockchain in accordance with the instructions you provide via our Services. The timing for completing any transfer will depend on the blockchain and other third-party actions that are outside the control of Streak or any of its affiliated entities, and Streak makes no guarantee regarding whether a transfer will be completed or the amount of time it may take to complete any transfer.</li>
                       <li> Custodianship: You own all NFTs held in your Hosted Wallet or transferred to your account. Streak does not own any NFTs that it holds for its customers. Although Streak controls the private keys for the blockchain addresses for deposited NFTs, you retain control of your NFTs while in the custody of Streak, subject to these Terms and applicable law. Your NFTs are tracked and maintained on internal ledgers maintained by Streak. Streak has no obligation to segregate any of your NFTs at a separate blockchain address. Your NFTs may be commingled at one or more blockchain addresses with NFTs owned by other users or Streak. For security and operational reasons, transfers of NFTs by you may be reflected on our internal ledgers only, without any transfer on the corresponding blockchain. Private keys may be stored by us offline or in electronic or physical vaults or other secure locations that may only be accessed in accordance with established security procedures, so any transfer of NFTs that will involve a transfer on the blockchain may be delayed.</li>
                        <li>Conditions and Restrictions on Transfer: Streak may at any time and in its sole discretion refuse any transfer request or other transaction request submitted via our Services, impose limits on the amounts of transfers that can be completed on a daily or other periodic basis, or impose any other conditions or restrictions upon your use of our Services, without prior notice. For example, Streak may: (a) limit the number of NFTs that can be purchased or sold on a daily or other periodic basis; (b) restrict transaction requests from certain locations; or (c) restrict withdrawals or other transactions if there is a reasonable suspicion of fraud, diminished capacity, inappropriate activity, or if Streak receives reasonable notice that your ownership of some or all of the NFTs in your account is in dispute.</li>
                       <li> Unclaimed Property: If we hold NFTs in your account or Hosted Wallet and have no record of your use of our Services for several years, we may be required, upon passage of applicable time periods, to report these NFTs as unclaimed property in accordance with the abandoned property and escheat laws. If this occurs, we will use reasonable efforts to give you written notice. If you fail to respond within seven business days or as required by law, we may be required to deliver any such NFTs to the applicable state or jurisdiction as unclaimed property. We reserve the right to deduct a dormancy fee or administrative fee from such unclaimed funds, as permitted by applicable law.</li>
                        <li>Property Disputes: If we receive notice that any NFTs held in your Hosted Wallet are alleged to have been stolen or otherwise not lawfully possessed by you, we may, but have no obligation to, place an administrative hold on the affected NFTs or your Hosted Wallet. If we place an administrative hold on some or all of your NFTs, we may continue the hold until the time when the dispute has been resolved and evidence of the resolution acceptable to Streak has been provided to Streak in a form acceptable to Streak. Streak will not involve itself in any such dispute or the resolution of the dispute.

                            <span>Subscription Services: Certain aspects of our Services, including access to Athlete profile pages, are provided to you on a subscription basis after you sign up for them ("Subscription Services"). Before you sign up for Subscription Services, we will disclose to you the duration of the Subscription Services (the "Subscription Period"), the applicable subscription fee, and other related information. For Subscription Services, we will charge a subscription fee following the initial date of your subscription to such Subscription Services, beginning on the day on which you initially subscribed to such Subscription Services and continuing on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the Subscription Period you selected, until you terminate such Subscription Services, cancel your account or we suspend or stop providing access to such Subscription Services. If you subscribe to any Subscription Services, you expressly acknowledge the following:

PLEASE REMEMBER THAT, UNLESS CANCELLED OR UNLESS WE SUSPEND OR STOP PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR A PERIOD EQUIVALENT TO THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD YOU SELECTED WHEN YOU INITIALLY SUBSCRIBED TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, AND WE WILL THEREFORE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE FEES TO YOU, ON A MONTHLY OR ANNUAL BASIS BEGINNING ON THE DAY ON WHICH YOU INITIALLY SUBSCRIBED TO SUCH SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, FOR THE ENTIRE AMOUNT PAYABLE DURING THE APPLICABLE MONTH OR YEAR (DEPENDING ON THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD YOU SELECTED).</li>
                                <li>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES IS CONTINUOUS UNTIL YOU CANCEL IT OR WE SUSPEND OR STOP PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS.</li>
                                <li>You may cancel your subscription to the Subscription Services at any time by via your mobile device’s subscription settings. While you may cancel your subscription to the Subscription Services at any time prior to the close of the applicable Subscription Period, you acknowledge and agree that any and all fees you have paid for your use of the Subscription Services are non-refundable and that you are responsible for the subscription fee for the entire Subscription Period that you selected. This means that, although you may cancel your subscription to the Subscription Services before the end of a given monthly or annual period, you remain responsible for the fees for that entire monthly or annual period, regardless of the date of cancelation. Notwithstanding your cancelation of the Subscription Services prior to the close of the applicable Subscription Period, you will, subject to these Terms, continue to have access to the Subscription Services for the duration of the applicable Subscription Period. Upon expiration of such Subscription Period, your access to the Subscription Services will automatically terminate.</li>
